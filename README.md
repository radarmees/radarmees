- 👋 Hi, I’m @radarmees
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in FPGA programming, mainly VHDL
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to get running with Xilinx Zynq boards. 
- My good old favourite CMOD-S6 is no longer available and Xilinx ISE suite does not run on any of my computers anymore.
- Even the next CMOD-A7 requires Vivado.
- 
- So far I am playing tennis in the darkness.
- The transition from experienced FPGA programmer with perfect feel-good zone to a complete idiot took less than 20 minutes.
- 
- We have this nice saying:
- 
- Theory is, if something should work, but does not do.
- Practice is, if something works, and nobody knows, why.
- We have combined Theory and Practice:
- Nothing works and nobody knows, why.....
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any VHDL project running with Zynq boards. 
- Any projects using the combination Vivado-Vitis-Arty boards is on the schedule.
